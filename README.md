# myShazam

This app allows me to view the shazamed songs that were deleted a while ago from my phone. 

It reads data from my list of deleted tags and displays them in a table view.
Each cell should contain the artist name, song track, and eventually the date.

#Version1 
Display a few tags from a hard coded lists of songs

#Version 2
Dislay all tags from a local JSON file
